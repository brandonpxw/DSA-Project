Quicksort works by selecting any element as pivot. Then, split the array into 3 parts: by following the ensuring that either all elements in this part should less than the pivot element, the single element or the elements in this part should greater than or equal to the pivot element. 

The benefits of Quicksort are as follows:
•	Quicksort is used for information searching and as Quicksort is the fastest algorithm.
•	It is used everywhere where a stable sort is not needed.
•	Quicksort is a cache-friendly algorithm.
•	It is tail -recursive and hence all the call optimization can be done.
•	It is an in-place sort that does not require any extra storage memory.
•	If data is sorted then the search for information became easy and efficient.
